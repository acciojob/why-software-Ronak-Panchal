<h1>
	Why I want to become a developer?
</h1>
	<p>I was always obsessed with computers, though, I still don’t know why. One of the reasons could be because when I was a kid, I had access to computers only in school and it wasn’t until 8th standard that we’ve had our own computer.
I get bored easily, with most of the stuff. When my father bought a computer home I was thrilled! But since the area we lived in had very poor internet quality I couldn’t explore the potential of the internet, still, in the next two years, I found few platforms to learn graphic designing and was experimenting with it.
I can say that in 11th standard I had decent exposure to programming, I took Computer Science as 5th subject. And now, as we had better internet connectivity and a laptop I could start exploring the internet. When my teacher started teaching us C++ , I found it really fascinating and fun, also it was kinda easy for me to learn it (here by easy I mean I took far less time in understanding concept than my peers) so it was fun. It gave me some kind confidence. I knew I had to be in this field.</p>
